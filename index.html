            <p>BaylorRPG is a text-based RPG currently in development that aims to be a fun-filled adventure text game set in the perspective of a Baylor student&#39;s daily life complete with all the quirks and inside humor a typical undergrad may encounter. Planned features include character customization, a battle system, inventory and skills menu, and a story-based adventure based on real locations and people on Baylor&#39;s campus.</p>
